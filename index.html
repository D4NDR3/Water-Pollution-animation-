         <p>This model represents the types of things that lead up to pollution in general, not just water pollution. Things like coprate busniess greed can affect pollution. Land is constanly bein cut down, and new factories and other busniess are being built, and that slowly pollutes the earth.
         Another major thing that slowly pollutes the earth is humanm nature. Things like laziness, and lack of information about how pollution can negativly affect the world, causes us to pollute the earth.</p>

<p> This was the code used to create a lighting affect that would make the animation actually look like its in the water. 
It contains code that makes the light cycle through dark blue, light blue, and white.</p>

                                   input.buttonA.onEvent(ButtonEvent.Click, function () {

      <p> This contains the code that will make a lighting affect that shows pollution.
      The lights cycle bewtween dark green, light green, and dark blue.</p>
